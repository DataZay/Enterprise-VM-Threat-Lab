# Enterprise-VM-Threat-Lab
Virtual enterprise network lab featuring Windows Server, Ubuntu endpoints, Active Directory, and a centralized Wazuh SIEM for real-time threat detection and monitoring.
---
## üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview

This lab replicates an enterprise network infrastructure featuring:

- **Active Directory Domain Controller** on Windows Server 2025  
- Multiple endpoints including Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux  
- A centralized **Wazuh SIEM Server** on Ubuntu with Elastic Stack  
- An attacker machine using Kali Linux to simulate real-world attack techniques  
- Services such as DNS, DHCP, MailHog, and file shares to emulate typical corporate resources  

The goal is to provide hands-on experience in deploying, configuring, attacking, and defending an enterprise environment.
